# cdproject. My Code Louisville FSJS Project is a web app designed for users who have hectic schedules to be able to get a daily bible verse while on the go. Additionally, there is a blog post discussing the verse, it's definition, how it applies to day to day life and what people can learn from it to better their own life.  The app is created using the MEAN stack which includes Mongo, Express.js, Angular.js as well as Node.js. This project requires using NPM, so in order to run the project you will first need to apply the steps below:
  -Go to root directory of project
  -Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
  -Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
  -Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
  -Open a localhost windows to the port it’s running on
